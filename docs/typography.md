# Typography Usage

Proper use of typography enhances readability, establishes hierarchy, and improves overall user experience.

## Best Practices

1. Maintain consistent use of font sizes and weights
2. Use appropriate line heights for optimal readability
3. Limit line length to 60-75 characters for body text
4. Use proper heading hierarchy (H1 > H2 > H3, etc.)
5. Ensure sufficient contrast between text and background

## Examples

- Body text: Use the 'base' size (16px) with regular weight
- Main headings: Use 'xl' or '2xl' sizes with semibold or bold weight
- Subheadings: Use 'lg' size with medium or semibold weight
- Small print: Use 'sm' or 'xs' sizes for less important information

By following these guidelines, you'll create typography that is both visually appealing and highly readable.

## Font Families

Octagon uses carefully selected font families to ensure readability and visual appeal across different platforms.

### Primary Font: Lexend

Lexend is our primary font family, chosen for its excellent readability and modern appearance.

```css
font-family: 'Lexend', sans-serif;
```

### Weights

- Light: 300
- Regular: 400
- Medium: 500
- Semibold: 600
- Bold: 700

### Monospace Font: Fira Code

For code snippets and monospaced text, we use Fira Code.

```css
font-family: 'Fira Code', monospace;
```

By consistently using these font families, we maintain a cohesive and professional look across all Octagon-based interfaces.

## Typography Scale

Octagon uses a consistent typography scale to maintain hierarchy and readability.

### Scale

- xs: 12px / 16px line height
- sm: 14px / 20px line height
- base: 16px / 24px line height
- lg: 18px / 28px line height
- xl: 20px / 30px line height
- 2xl: 24px / 32px line height
- 3xl: 30px / 36px line height
- 4xl: 36px / 40px line height

### Headings

- h1: 3xl (30px)
- h2: 2xl (24px)
- h3: xl (20px)
- h4: lg (18px)
- h5: base (16px)
- h6: sm (14px)

Use this scale consistently to create clear visual hierarchies in your typography.
