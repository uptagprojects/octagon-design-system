# Logo Usage

Our logo is a key element of the identity at the PNFi. To maintain consistency we recommend follow these guidelines:

## Correct Usage

- **Clear Space**: Maintain a minimum clear space around the logo to ensure visibility and impact. The clear space should be at least the height of the logo.
- **Minimum Size**: The logo should never be smaller than 40px in height for digital use and 0.5 inches for print.
- **Color Variations**: Use the logo in its original colors. If necessary, a monochrome version (black or white) can be used on contrasting backgrounds.

## Incorrect Usage

- **Do Not Distort**: Do not stretch, compress, or otherwise distort the logo.
- **Do Not Change Colors**: Do not alter the logo colors.
- **Do Not Add Effects**: Avoid adding shadows, changing the gradient, or other effects to the logo.
- **Do Not Rotate**: The logo should always be oriented horizontally.


By following these guidelines, you help ensure that our octagon remains strong and consistent, but any suggestion or improvement is more than welcome :)
